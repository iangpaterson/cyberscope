			<p>Our Site may contain links to other third party websites.

			<h3>How We Secure Information About You</h3>

					<h4>About Cyberscope TV</h4>
					<h5>
						Cyberscope TV is a crowd sharing platform for opportunites, challenges and technologies changing the world of Cyber Security.
					</h5>
					<p>
						We have secured our on screen comments and chat using an RSA algorithm. Video and audio chats use WebRTC technology which in its turn makes use of DTLS protocol by default. Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) is used to provide communications privacy for datagram protocols. This fosters a secure signaling channel that cannot be tampered with. In other words, no eavesdropping or message forgery can occur on a DTLS encrypted connection.
					</p>
					<p>
						As regards our storage and streaming, we use OAuth plus our additional authenticated and encrypted connection channels to deliver data only to authorised users.
